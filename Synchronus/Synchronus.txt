Synchronous JavaScript
Definition: Code is executed line-by-line, one at a time, in a sequential order.
Each line of code blocks the execution of the next line until it is completed.
If one operation takes a long time (e.g., file read, API call), the program will wait (block) until it finishes.

Key Behavior:
Code executes top to bottom.
Each task waits for the previous one to finish before starting.
If a task takes time, the whole program pauses.
