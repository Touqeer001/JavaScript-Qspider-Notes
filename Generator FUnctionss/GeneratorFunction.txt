Key Points about yield and Generators:

yield: Pauses the generator and sends a value to the calling code.
.next(): Resumes execution from the last yield and returns the next value (or ends if the function is finished).
done: A property of the object returned by .next(). It tells if the generator has finished running.

Generator Function:

Executes lazily and can be paused and resumed using the yield keyword.
Returns an iterator object instead of a value.


Generator Function:

Can pause execution at yield statements and resume later using the iterator's .next() method.


Generator Function:

Returns an iterator object which produces a sequence of values when iterated.
